# NXT-python-rubiks-cube-solver-

This is a set of programs used by my Mindstorms NXT robot which can solve a rubiks cube. Will add additional information later.

Requirements:
Python 2.7.x
NXT-python (python2 branch) https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python
graphics.py http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/
OpenCV http://opencv.org/
Numpy
Optional: Matplotlib

The main program of this project is cubeSolver.py, which calls functions from all other files. Except for cubecoordinates.py,
which is a standalone application that generates a random cube, finds a solution, displays the solution and finally shows an
animation of the cube being solved
